# Arcanum App

Welcome to **Arcanum App**, an open-source project designed to empower developers with a seamless system for extracting and managing web components. **Arcanum** aims to automate the component extraction process while listing essential data needs, integrating these features with backend systems like **NEA** to enhance data-driven web applications.

> **Note:** This repository is in its conceptual phase and does not yet contain any code. We invite the community to participate and help us shape this project.

## Project Inspiration

The idea for **Arcanum App** came from the need for a cohesive extraction and integration mechanism within dynamic component-based systems. This project draws inspiration from several automation and extraction tools that facilitate integration between UI components and backend systems, aiming to simplify and streamline the workflow.

Inspired by concepts in automation frameworks and dynamic UI generation tools, **Arcanum** sets out to automate component extraction and provide an integrated data-listing feature.

## Vision

**Arcanum App** aims to provide:

- **Automated component extraction** to streamline the integration of UI components into projects.
- A **data-listing feature** that identifies and lists the data requirements of extracted components.
- **Integration capabilities** with backend management systems like **NEA** for dynamic data handling.
- **Seamless connectivity** between extracted components and data sources for a fully functional architecture.

## Current Status

This project is at an **early planning stage**. We are currently focusing on refining the core concept and developing an initial roadmap based on community feedback.
